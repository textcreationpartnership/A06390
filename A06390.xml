            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:10179:4"/>Héer are two forcible reaſons added to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, to mooue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſraell diligently to obſerue the Saboth. Firſt for that it is a ſure ſigne of their ſanctification that they being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by the lothſome flithynes of ſinne, are ſanctified by the Lord and made ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in his ſight.

If we wil (as we ought) vſe and obſerue it according to that exquiſit order which the Lord hath preſcribed in his Sacred woord: we muſt not doo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing that pleaſeth our ſelues: we muſt not ſpeak our owne woords:<note place="margin">56. 2.</note> we muſt not doo after our owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither ſeek our owne wil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">58. 13.</note> we muſt keep our ſelues that we doo no euil in the Lords holy day. But it is not inough to eſchew euil: but we muſt alſo doo good. Therfore in halowing the Lords day of

Now if this ſtraight line be laid to our crooked liues, and this iuſt rule to our vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruly behaueour: oh how far out of ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſhall we be found? For when doo we more practiſe our vain pleaſures: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo we more after our owne wicked im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination? When doo we more ſéek our owne froward wil? When doo we more ſpeak our owne filthy &amp; corrupt woords? When doo we exerciſe more euil then on the Lords day? As for other dayes euery man in his vocation (if he haue any natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall care to maintain him ſelf and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie) wil apply his worldly buſineſſe, he wil not let a char. But the holy Saboth is ſo vnholyly ſpent, as if it were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the abhominable idole of fleſhly pleaſure, rather then to the true ſeruice of the almighty God: for if there be any match made for the triall of any maſtrie, or méeting for meriment (as they terme it) either betwéen town &amp; town, or neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour &amp; neighbour, or if there be any kéep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing

If any go about with a pewter or rather pilfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring game (becauſe by offering a ſhewe of profit, it priuily robbeth men) when muſt it be played but vpon the Sabaoth day? And who more to be blamed for this then ſuch Iuſtices vnder whoſe licence they doo it? is this y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way for Magiſtrates to ſhowe them ſelues men fearing God, to giue men licences wheby they may re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>belliouſly break Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements them ſelues,<note place="margin">
